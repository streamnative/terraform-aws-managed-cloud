# Tiered Storage for AWS

This terraform module creates the needed s3 bucket  
and IAM policies, plus role creation/attachment  
that is needed for storage offloading in Pulsar.

This bucket also enables bucket encrpytion by default

See the parameters for full details but here is an example usage:

```
module "storage_offloading" {
  source = "streamnative/managed-cloud/aws"
  bucket_name = "myorg-pulsar-offload-us-east-1"
  bucket_tags = {
    Project = "MyApp"
    Environment = "Prod"
  }
  # attach policy to existing role
  existing_role_name = "my-pulsar-cluster-role"
}
```
